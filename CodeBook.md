#Getting and Cleaning Data course project - Codebook
This document describes the various variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data included in the provided data set.

##Original data source
The original data for the project were downloaded from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

Please refer to the README.txt, features_info.txt and features.txt files for information on the various measurements and parameters of the original data set.

##Variables
The following paragraphs provide information regarding the variables used in the data set. Please note that the elements in the data set have no units since the measurements have been normalized.  
1. **Average_timeBodyAcc_mean_X, Average_timeBodyAcc_mean_Y, Average_timeBodyAcc_mean_Z**  
These variables provide the average body mean acceleration in each of the X, Y, Z axes.  

2. **Average_timeBodyAcc_std_X, Average_timeBodyAcc_std_Y, Average_timeBodyAcc_std_Z**  
These variables provide the average body standard deviation of the acceleration in each of the X, Y, Z axes.  


3. **Average_timeGravityAcc_mean_X, Average_timeGravityAcc_mean_Y, Average_timeGravityAcc_mean_Z**  
These variables provide the average mean gravitational acceleration in each of the X, Y, Z axes.  


4. **Average_timeGravityAcc_std_X, Average_timeGravityAcc_std_Y, Average_timeGravityAcc_std_Z**  
These variables provide the average standard deviation of the gravitational acceleration in each of the X, Y, Z axes.
